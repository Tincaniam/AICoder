# AI Coder Project: Job Tracker Web App

# Introduction
The aim of this project is to explore the efficiency and effectiveness of leveraging AI tools in developing a Job Tracker web application. The application intends to provide users with the ability to track job applications, required skills, and networking contacts. This document serves as a foundational roadmap, guiding our team through the initial planning and development phases.

# Background and Prior Approaches
Traditional development methodologies, whether Agile or Waterfall, typically involve a manual approach to coding, testing, and deployment. However, with the recent advancements in AI and machine learning, developers now have the opportunity to leverage these tools for enhanced productivity and potentially superior outcomes. There exists a potential for AI to scaffold project architectures, optimize database queries, or even offer frontend design suggestions. The extent of this potential is what our team seeks to uncover.

# Installation instructions
This project contains two applications, a backend and a frontend. These can be ran locally on the same machine. Detailed instructions are available in the README of both application folders, but in general, you can run both by navigating to the respective application and running the commands: `npm install` followed by `npm start`.
